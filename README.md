## Config Options

### File Structure

The structure of the `config.json` file is as follows:
```
{
    "email": "example@email.com",
    "blockedDomains": [
        "youtube.com",
        "imgur.com"
    ],
    "subreddits": [
        {
            "name": "webdev",
            "limit": 10
        },
        {
            "name": "technology",
            "limit": 15
        }
    ]
}
```

Below are the options for the `config.json` file. The only required option is `email`, which must be a valid email address. Everything else is optional. If a subreddit is specified, the `name` attribute is required, and all other attributes are optional.
